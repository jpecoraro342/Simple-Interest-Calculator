Simple-Interest-Calculator
==========================

This is a Simple Interest Calculator made in Objective C for IOS Devices. This calculator can calculate interest compounded at a given number of intervals per year, or continuously. It also can calculate interest with annual additions. The proper portion of the annual addition is added prior to each comounding period. The program does work with annual additions, and continuously compounded interest. The annual additions in the case of continuously compounded interest is added at intervals of each month. 

I made this app due to there being a lack of a free interest calculator that met my needs on the app store. The only free interest calculator apps were very limited in functionality, and didn't do everything I needed them to, so I made this app. I plan to publish either this app, or some variation of it with more functionality in the near future. 

There will be a more complex interest calculator with many more features coming sometime soon, so look out for it!
