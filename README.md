Simple-Interest-Calculator
==========================

This is a Simple Interest Calculator made in Objective C for IOS Devices. This calculator can calculate interest compounded at a given number of intervals per year, or continuously. It also can calculate interest with annual additions. The proper portion of the annual addition is added prior to each comounding period. The program does work with annual additions, and continuously compounded interest. The annual additions in the case of continuously compounded interest is added at intervals of each month. 

There will be a more complex interest calculator with many more features coming out in the near future, so look out for it!
